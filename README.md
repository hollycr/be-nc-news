# Northcoders News API

In order to run this project locally, you must create two .env files (.env.test and .env.development) in order to connect to the two databases locally. Within these files, set your PGDATABASE to nc_news_test and nc_news respectively (PGDATABASE=nc_news within .env.development and PGDATABASE=nc_news_test within .env.test).
